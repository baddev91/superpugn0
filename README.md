I'll get straight to the point. I'm a young **nerd** (not so much, I'm 31) and I'm trying to make myself useful by doing what I do best: **writing code**.

Some web agencies occasionally need the 'trusted nerd' to solve that '**problem with the API**', create custom functions or whatever.

There, I like to think of myself as that person there, *your friendly neighbourhood nerd* :-D

I have been involved in digital marketing for 7 years but in the last year my passion for programming has prevailed.

I love implementing code in **Wordpress**, creating **Apps** and **online platforms** creating both frontend and backend (and let's not forget the database!).

**I don't want a job contract**: I'd be super happy just to solve a problem once in a while (and at a bargain price!).

Whenever you want I'm available for a friendly phone call :-)
