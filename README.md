# Who is SUPERPUGN0?

## The reality behind this mysterious name.

Hey there! My name is Mattia and, due to my passion for martial arts, I've been using the nickname SUPERPUGN0 for a few years now.

Anyway, let's talk about coding!

I created my first websites at the age of 12 using Frontpage. I've always been a bit of a nerd, but not too much.

In 2016, I discovered Wordpress and worked as a Digital Marketer for about 7 years.

Although I really enjoyed the psychological aspects of this field, the technical parts were what excited me the most.

In January 2023, I decided to quit my job and study full-time with CodeCademy to become a Frontend Developer.

My studies are still ongoing, but I'm starting to see some results with some small projects I've developed. Nothing special, but I'm proud of them!

I hope to find a company soon that will hire me so that I can put into practice what I'm learning.
